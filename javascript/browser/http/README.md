# Browser Example (prototype)

**WARNING**: This is a proof of concept that is still a work in progress. Do not use for your applications.

To run the prototype, checkout the repo, create a .env file with `DD_CLIENT_TOKEN` set to your client token, and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Requests are sent to `http://localhost:8080/users` and assume that the [microservices](/javascript/node/microservices) example is running.
