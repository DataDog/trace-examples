If You\n   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n   as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution.

The contents\n       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n   file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n   same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n   identification within third-party archives.\n\nCopyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n\thttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n"

         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n   the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n   comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n   file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n   same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n   identification within third-party archives.\n\nCopyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n\thttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n"

If You\n   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n   as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n   meet the following conditions:\n\n   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n       stating that You changed the files; and\n\n   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n       the Derivative Works; and\n\n   (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
      the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1. Definitions.

         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

             stating that You changed the files; and

             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n   as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n   meet the following conditions:\n\n   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n       stating that You changed the files; and\n\n   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n       the Derivative Works; and\n\n   (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all

            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

             stating that You changed the files; and

             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1. Definitions.

         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

If You\n   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n   as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution.

The contents\n       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks.

Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.

While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

             stating that You changed the files; and

             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier

            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.
